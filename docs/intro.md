# Introduction

Novogenia offers APIs with which you can create new customers, edit the customer information and query the information. You can track the status of the orders and if available, download the report. You can also inquire whether our products are available.

# API Reference

The Novogenia Gateway API is organised around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses.

```http request title="BASE URL"
https://order-gateway.novogenialab.com/api/
```


## Not a Developer?
Don't worry, in our **[Dashboard](https://order-gateway.novogenialab.com/sign-in)**, you can work with our APIs without coding.
